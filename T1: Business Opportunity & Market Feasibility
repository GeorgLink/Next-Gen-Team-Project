#Business Idea
Provide a credit card software company that partners with local banks in Africa. Our goal is to provide all the online software for online 
banking to the developing countries of Africa.


 * Software Developments: Credit/Account monitoring, communication with banks, security, marketing.

##Custormer Information
  
 * People in Africa can't purchase things online because they don't have access to credit cards. We would provide that service to allow
   them to make online purchases.
 * Our business would be for-profit and would need to partner with a manufacturer to get cards. 
 * The banks would pay us for software and part of the money per transaction

##Goals
 * Over the next 5 years our goals are to start small and expand across Africa to provide credit card services to those who do not have it.
 * Customer satisfaction, security, and expansion are our main goals
