Cade - Last semester, my group created an app called Study Buddy. It's like Tinder, but it's not for relationships.
Study Buddy is an app idea that allows like-minded students to match and study together.
I still have the app so you guys could see it.

This is the app my old team and I created if you want  to check it out.
