# Key Resources
Our major key resources include a database server and cloud servers, as well as the distribution of our credit card. We will buy a database server to hold customer information and a web server to hold our website that makes shopping simple. In addition, we will need to hire software developers to develop our website as well as our credit card software. We will have a building in the US with offices, computers, and workers to work from. Some key resources also include a patent for protection of our intellectual property, and a loan to keep our business out of debt in the startup phase.
