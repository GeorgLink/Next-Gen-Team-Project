Team Leader: Nate

# Cost Structure
 * Based on how much money we get from our sponsers, that will determine what server we get. Cloud Servers are cheapest so we may be able to use these for a few years. Roughly $320 a month.
 * We will want to pay our employees a competitive wage. Around $12 an hour for lower level employees.
 * Depending on the banks cooperation, they may charge us for using them as a partner.
 * Amazon may charge us for using their service as well.
 * Ads and campaigning that gets our name out there.

# Revenue Streams
  * Our first step is finding reputable donors and foundations that may be doing what we are doing. The Obakki foundation and UNICEF are examples of foundations we would propose to.
  * While gaining money from our donors and sponsors, We could make money selling t-shirts or other memrobilia.
  * Develop a 10 cent card few from the bank. 
 

## Three-Year Plan
 * Year one - Talk to donors and foundations that may be interested in our cause. Then determine how much money we will recieve. If lower amount we will purchase cloud servers for our business. If large we will develop physical servers for maximum usage.
 * Year two - Apply for 501(c)(3) Status which allows us to be exempt from federal taxes. Continue developing our database for quicker speeds and better handling. 
 * Year three - Our website will be at it's finest and we will start to campaign in developing countires in Africa to gain more users and inform them of our service and cause.
