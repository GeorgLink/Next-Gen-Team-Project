# Key Partners
Our main business partner will be the local banks in Africa since they directly connect with our customers. The banks will provide us the money and basic platform for our cards to use, and they would hand out/sell our cards. Our cloud servers are also a key partner as the server site will host our website along with user information. Initially our cloud servers will be in the US, but eventually we hope to move our servers to Africa to locally host our website. Finally, Amazon will be our key partner in selling items on our website. We will work through them to create a place for people to purchase from, and Amazon will provide us with their catalog of items. Any other online or physical retail space in which our cards are used are also key partners.
