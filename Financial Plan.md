# Financial Plan
Our initial startup costs are rather high, like any business. Our cloud server hosting will be $320/month, and employees will be paid $12/hr for low-skill jobs and $50,000+ for high-skill jobs. Advirtisement will be around $100 CPM (per 1000 impressions), so costs will be low to start and rise as we increase marketing. Additional costs include charges from local African banks and our partnership with Amazon, as well as anything else that may arise.

For revenue, donations/sponserships will keep us afloat in the first years. The Obakki foundation and UNICEF are examples of foundations we would propose to, and GoFundMe and other fundraisers are also an option. Our card fees and interest are our main revenue makers, where we will have a 1-2% transaction fee and a competative yet reasonable interest with 15-20% APR and 3% for transfers. We will have a 10Â¢ card fee from the banks. With 300,000+ page visits per month, we can expect around $300,000 in revenue our third year. We will also sell merchandize as an additional revenue stream.

For our three year plan, our first year we will talk to donors and foundations that may be interested in our cause, then determine how much money we will recieve. If funding is low we will purchase cloud servers for our business. If funding is large we will develop physical servers for maximum usage. The second year we will apply for 501(c)(3) Status which allows us to be exempt from federal taxes. We will continue developing our database for quicker speeds and better handling. In our third year, our website will be at it's finest and we will start to campaign in developing countires in Africa to gain more users and inform them of our service and cause. Next-Gen has the resources and financial plan to be very successful with our target demographic.
