# Customer Relationships
We want a professional relationship where we can trust the card owners and the card owners can trust us. They just want us to give them a quality product that works as advertised. We can acquire customers as the country develops, because we would have been there for a while so we would have brand power. The more customers we can get, the more we can provide. We deliver quality, reliable products and our customers will reward us with their continued business. We will also do random promotions and create a social media presence to keep our customers engaged. Sign up bonuses, rewards for referrals, and other methods could be introduced after we create our company to keep new customers flowing in.

We will also have phone centers, a mail center, and 24/7 online support to maximize support. We need everyone to understand what we provide and how we can help them. We can work with local TV stations and broadcasting in order to motivate our costomers with maximum informations. Providing more advitersing can help spreading our business as well. By offering a great product and keeping our customers engaged, we hope to win our customer loyalty.
