Ideas for connecting with customers

How do you raise customer awareness? How can customers evaluate your offerings? 
How do they purchase from you? How do you deliver value? How do you provide support?

Then describe how you would maintain customer relationships with your customer segments. 
What type of relationship do your customers expect from your organization?
Can you use these relationships to acquire, retain, and upsell customer segments? 
Consider direct personal assistance (either online or in person), self-service, automated services, user communities, etc.

While describing these approaches to interacting with your customer segments, make sure that they fit clearly within your business idea.
