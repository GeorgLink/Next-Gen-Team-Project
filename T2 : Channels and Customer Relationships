#Customer Relations

Team leader - Nate Andres

##How we will connect with customers?
Africa doesn't have many businesses like us, so we would sort of be a monopoly for a while. Us providing cards to buy things online is a modern
day necessity. Customer awareness would sort of spread by word of mouth as we are the only company offering the product. They could evaluate our 
products through their normal banks that they have been using.
We can work with local TV stations and broadcasting in order to motivate our costomers with maximum information, providing more 
advitersing can help spreading our business as well. 
This new approach can somehow enhences our costomers confidence.

##Support and Purchasing

We would work with banks so we would be bought from a bank. We would provide 24/7 support lines and mail. 
Our main goal is to provide the cards so that things can be bought online in a quick and orderly manner.
Value is provided because they currently can't buy things online efficiently and we would be the first company to give our 
customers that ability.

##Maintaining Customers
We would gain feeback from our custormers in the form of a survey of some sorts. Start a mailing list to let our custormers
know what's going on.
We'd also gain feedback through our partner banks, if customers come to them with an issue they could relay
the information to us.

##Our Relationship with the Customers
We want a professional relationship where we can trust the card owners and the card owners can trust us.
They just want us to give them a quality product that works as advertised.

##Gaining More Loyal Customers
We can acquire customers as the country develops, because we would have been there for a while so we would have
brand power.
The more customers we can get, the more we can provide.
We deliver quality, reliable products and our customers will reward us with their continued business.

##How We can Help our Customers
We would have phone centers, a mail center, and 24/7 online support to maximize support. We need everyone to understand what we provide
and how we can help them.
We can work with local TV stations and broadcasting in order to motivate our costomers with maximum informations. 
Providing more advitersing can help spreading our business as well. 
This new approach can somehow enhences our costomers confidence.
