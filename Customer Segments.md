# Customer Segments
We plan to market our specific customer segment toward the adult population in Africa. Africa is a very large, spread out country, so our starting customer segment will be directed toward large cities including Nairobi, Lagos, and Johannesburg, since denser populations will be easier and more beneficial to implement. Our starting city will be Lagos, Nigeria, with a population of over 21 million, and we will continue to move on our customer market from there. Approximately 9 out of 10 transactions in Africa are made with cash, so there is a need and want for credit card usage and online shopping. Our demographic will have to be financially independent, so naturally more middle-class to upper-class African citizens will apply and get accepted for our card. It should be easy to gain an initial clientele through efficient marketing and because we have no competitors.
