# Customer Segments
As a credit card company, we plan to market our specific customer segment toward people in Africa. Africa is a very large, spread out country, so our starting customer segment will be directed toward large cities including Nairobi, Lagos, and Johannesburg, since denser populations will be easier and more beneficial to implement. Our starting city will be Lagos, Nigeria, with a population of over 21 million, and we will continue to move on our customer market from there.

Approximately 9 out of 10 transactions in Africa are made with cash, so there is a need and want for credit card usage and the convenience and safety that it provides. As our product reaches our target market, naturally more middle-class to upper-class African citizens will apply and get accepted for the Next Generation credit card. Most large, world-wide businesses in African cities will already have credit card readers, and as the number of individuals with credit cards grow this will only become more popular.
