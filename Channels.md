# Channels
The main channels that we will use is with advertisements. This will be through broadcasting TV ads, online advertisements, and word-of-mouth. Besides advertisement, we will also communicate through our website, helplines, and a mailing list to our loyal customers. We will gain feeback from our custormers in the form of a survey, and we'll also gain feedback through our partner banks. Our customers are our top priority, we want to make this business as easy for them to be apart of. Africa doesn't have many businesses like us, and we want as many avenues to provide assistance so any customer can get the help they need.
