# Next-Gen-Team-Project
Repository for our team project in Orgs, Apps, and Tech.


Things we need
1. A team leader for the T1 assignment followed by a business idea

2. An online business idea.
Credit Card software company to partner with local banks. Provide all the online software for online banking also. (Kossi's Idea)
  - Software Developments: Credit/Account monitoring, communication with banks, security, marketing.

3. Develop the value propositions you would want to offer the customer segment(s). Consider a wide range of possibilities 
such as online retail, non-profit, business-to-business, or government contracting. Consider products, services, information, 
and/or transaction support. If you select a non-profit business, it must be able to sustain itself financially.

4.Describe your customer segment(s) clearly and in detail. Then provide a complete overview of the online business, including 
a clear description of the line of products and/or services. Given that the initial line of products or services is commonly 
a starting point rather than a full selection, indicate how the product or service goals are expected develop over the next five years.
