# Value Propositions
Our value proposition that we want to offer our customers is the ability to shop online through our credit card capabilities. Many Africans do not have access to online shopping, and we want to help them develop with our easy-to-use shopping portal. Items can be bought through our custom made credit cards that can be purchased from the banks. We will provide transaction support, as well as many different software developments such as credit and account monitoring, communication with banks, and security behind our service.

We are a for-profit company, and our plan is to start off in the city of Lagos. Over the next 5 years, we will expand our card options and the cities they are provided in, as well as our website. We will offer different cards and our website options will grow. We will expand across many cities in Africa, including Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Cape Town. Our main focus during this time will be customer satisfaction, security, and expansion.
