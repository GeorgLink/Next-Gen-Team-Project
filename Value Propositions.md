# Value Propositions
Our value proposition that we want to offer our customer segment is the ability to use online transactions through our credit card capabilities. Because a majority of Africa uses cash, our value in a credit card is the ability to shop online using services such as Amazon, Walmart, or other local businesses that deliver, which many Africans do not have access to online. We will provide transaction support, as well as many different software developments such as credit and account monitoring, communication with banks, and security behind our service.

Next Generation is a for-profit company, and our plan is to start off with a single credit card option in the city of Lagos. Over the next 5 years, we will expand our card options and the cities they are provided in. We will offer different benefit cards, student cards, and cards for the low-income or with credit building. We will expand across many cities in Africa, including Johannesburg, Nairobi, and Cape Town. Our main focus during this time will be customer satisfaction, security, and expansion.
